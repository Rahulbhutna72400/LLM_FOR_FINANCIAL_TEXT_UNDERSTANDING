Covid-19: Apollo teams up with OYO, Lemon Tree, Ginger Hotels to create 5,000 isolation rooms Joining hands with partners including HUL, SBI and OYO, Apollo Hospitals plans to scale this capacity to up to 5,000 rooms where patients can stay in isolation. Healthcare major Apollo Hospitals said it has launched 'Project Stay I' with 500 rooms in select hotels across the country in the first phase with light medical supervision for quarantine. This effort is aimed at creating isolation and quarantine facilities and reducing the burden on hospitals providing acute care.  Joining hands with partners including HUL, SBI and OYO, Apollo Hospitals plans to scale this capacity to up to 5,000 rooms where patients can stay in isolation.  'Project Stay I' (Stay Isolated) is a part of its 'Project Kavach' announced last week by Apollo Hospitals Group Chairman Prathap C Reddy to fight the VOVID-19 pandemic.  &amp;quot;Apollo along with our partners commits to add up to 5,000 rooms where patients can stay in isolation. These will be 5,000 telemedicine medically supervised beds so that those who are in isolation stay in isolation and don't spread the infection to others,&amp;quot; Apollo Hospitals Group Joint MD Sangita Reddy said.  Isolation is not possible in many Indian homes where 5-7 people stay in the same room and where they share a bathroom, she said.  &amp;quot;So we realised for those who can't afford, there was need to find capacity to cover the cost, and HUL, SBI and Deutsche Bank have come forward and said for those who cannot afford it they will cover the cost of care,&amp;quot; she added.  &amp;quot;Apollo Hospitals is not charging for the the telemedicine network or our medical supervision. Only the medicines will be charged at actual costs and the MRPs,&amp;quot; Reddy said.  As part of phase 1, Apollo Hospitals is launching around 500 rooms in Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi which will be scaled up to 5,000 rooms across other cities in successive phases on the basis pf further assessment, she added.  &amp;quot;Project Stay I will help to 'Break the chain' and is expected to help over?10,000 patients in a month and prevent over 50 lakh infections,&amp;quot; Reddy said.  For the 'Project Stay I', initiative Apollo Hospitals has partnered with hospitality chains such as Lemon Tree Hotels, Ginger Hotels and OYO and online restaurant guide and food ordering platform Zomato.  Apart from them, leading entities such as HUL, State Bank of India and Deutsche Bank have also joined hands in the initiative.  The objective is to create isolation and quarantine facilities away from the main hospitals in cities across the country and reduce the burden on hospitals providing acute care.  &amp;quot;The steps taken by the Government of India in screening, testing and keeping high risk individuals in state quarantine facilities to prevent the extensive spread of the disease is indeed commendable. However, with increase in the scale and scope of testing, the number of positive cases are expected to increase,&amp;quot; Reddy said in the media conference call.  There will also be a rise in the number of individuals requiring to be quarantined due to contact with COVID-19 patients. This will put a huge load on the government facilities for quarantine. This is the time for the private sector to step up to the challenge to aid, augment, and support the government, she added.  The model is envisaged to have a combination of self-paying and CSR funded customers, Apollo Hospitals said.  On the development, HUL Chairman and MD Sanjiv Mehta said: &amp;quot;Isolation facilities are extremely important to curb the spread of this virus. As Hindustan Unilever we are delighted to partner with organisations like Apollo Hospitals, State Bank of India, Oyo, Lemon Tree and many more to help create isolation facilities.&amp;quot;  This will help in augmenting the quarantine system already put in place by the government, he added.  Biocon Chairperson and MD Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said: &amp;quot;We have a very small window of opportunity to really make a success of lockdown, of quarantine and making sure we don't get overwhelmed in terms of the need for critical care.&amp;quot;  'Project Stay I' is a very important initiative that is being embarked upon. This is a model that needs to emulated by all the hospitals and hotels put together, she added.  OYO Founder &amp;amp;amp; Group CEO Ritesh Agarwal said: &amp;quot;Our partnership with Apollo Hospitals has been developed to ensure we utilise capacity where possible to create highly sanitised pay per use quarantine facilities under the guidance and supervision of medical professionals.&amp;quot;  This is an unprecedented situation which requires all of us to find new ways to work together and rise to the occasion, he added.  Highlighting the need of the initiative, Deutsche Bank India Chief Country Officer Kaushik Shaparia said: &amp;quot;We've seen with other countries that people needing intensive medical care can very quickly outrun the available facilities. This partnership is a step towards addressing that challenge and the model provides an excellent way by which to respond quickly to people in need and curtail further spread of the disease.&amp;quot;  On their role in 'Project Stay I', Zomato Co-Founder &amp;amp;amp; COO Gaurav Gupta said: &amp;quot;We are glad to team up with Apollo Hospitals and other service providers for 'Project Stay I' and lend our services to make sure people in isolation have access to good food. We are enabling our network for the supply and employing our logistics capabilities to facilitate daily meals.&amp;quot;  Stating that Lemon Tree Hotels has been in the forefront in partnering with government on fight against COVID-19 pandemic, Lemon Tree Hotels President Vikramjit Singh said: &amp;quot;From the beginning of this crisis, Lemon Tree has supported state governments in offering quarantine accommodation and we are now happy to partner with Apollo Hospitals on 'Project Stay I'.&amp;quot;  Lemon Tree Hotels believes it is extremely important for the private sector, especially hospitality, to play an active role in helping the government control this pandemic, he added.

SBI General Insurance FY20 net profit up 23.4% at Rs 412 crore SBI General&rsquo;s gross written premium rose by 45 percent YoY to Rs 6,840 crore in FY20 Private sector non-life insurer SBI General Insurance posted a 23.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in FY20 net profit to Rs 412 crore helped by a healthy topline growth.  The insurer had a profit after tax of Rs 333.9 crore in the year-ago period (FY19), as per its public disclosures.  SBI General&rsquo;s gross written premium rose 45 percent YoY to Rs 6,840 crore in FY20. The&nbsp;underwriting profit was at Rs 61 crore in FY20 compared to Rs 79 crore in the year-ago period.  The key differentiator for the company has been the diversified product portfolio spread across the motor, health, home, personal accident, commercial lines and crop insurance, the insurer said in a statement.  SBI General is a joint venture between State Bank of India, Premji Invest and Warburg Pincus Group. Australia's IAG which was earlier a joint venture partner exited SBI General by selling its 26 percent to&nbsp;Premji Invest and Warburg Pincus Group in March 2020.  Pushan Mahapatra, MD and CEO said, &ldquo;SBI General has maintained a steady growth of 45 percent as compared to industry growth of around 12 percent for FY19-20. Despite being one of the younger players in the sector, we have seen impressive progress since commencing operations. Growth has been evident across all lines of businesses.&rdquo;  The insurer&rsquo;s profit before tax (PBT) stood at Rs 564 crore in FY20 as against Rs 470 crore in the year-ago period. &nbsp;The company reported an incurred loss ratio of 71.1 percent in FY20 compared to 72 percent in FY19.  SBI General&rsquo;s combined ratio of 98 percent in FY20 compared to 96.7 percent in the year-ago period. The non-life insurer&rsquo;s solvency stood at 227 percent as against the regulatory requirement of 150 percent. In FY19, the solvency stood at 234 percent.  A combined ratio below 100 percent indicates an insurance company is making underwriting profits.

Bright spots emerge in life insurance sector amidst COVID-19 lockdown Though there was a decline in new premiums, the rate of decrease was significantly lower than previous months. Among listed insurers, SBI Life Insurance sees a 14.7 percent YoY growth in new premiums Almost three months after the&nbsp;COVID-19-led national lockdown, life insurance companies are seeing some bright spots in new premium collection. Even though there was a decline in new premiums, the rate of decrease was significantly lower than previous months.  Data from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) showed that the private sector industry saw a 1.28 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in June 2020 new premiums. In May 2020, there was a 28.3 percent decline.  LIC, which saw a 24.3 percent YoY decline in new premiums at Rs 10,211.53 crore in May 2020, saw a 12.7 percent decline in June 2020.  Since the restrictions were lifted in June 2020, there has been a built-up in momentum of policy sales, industry sources said.  &ldquo;During April and May, bank branches were not able to sell any policy. That was not the case in June and the industry benefited,&rdquo; said the chief distribution officer of a mid-sized private life insurer.  &amp;amp;nbsp;    Overall, the industry saw a 10.5 percent YoY decline in new premiums at Rs 28,868.7 crore in June 2020. For the June quarter (Q1), the life insurance industry saw an 18.6 percent YoY decline in new premiums at Rs 49,335.44 crore.  In&nbsp;May 2020, there was a 25.4 percent YoY decrease in new premiums.  A report by Kotak Institutional Equities said that private life insurers reported 7 percent individual annualised premium equivalent (APE) decline in June 2020.  &ldquo;Traction in individual protection policies, selective push of non-participating business and uptick in business through digital channels were likely drivers while unit linked insurance product (Ulips) volumes were weak,&rdquo; said the report.  Among the listed insurers,&nbsp;SBI Life Insurance&nbsp;saw a 14.7 percent YoY growth in new premiums in June 2020, at Rs 1,502.44 crore, making it the largest private life insurer by new premium collection.&nbsp;HDFC Life Insurance&nbsp;saw a 0.9 percent YoY decline in new premiums for June 2020 to Rs 1,346.68 crore.  ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, however, saw a 37 percent YoY decline in new premiums to Rs 564.56 crore. The Kotak report said that the insurer saw a higher decline than peers due to a likely slowdown in Ulips, with a 35 percent YoY drop in average ticket size to Rs 58,974 in individual regular business in June.  &amp;amp;nbsp;    On the one hand, while bank-led insurance sales have started picking up, the insurance industry is still waiting for the individual agents&rsquo; field visits to resume.  Field agents account for 40-45 percent of the total life insurance business every year but the lockdown has made it impossible for them to travel.  &ldquo;Even though the lockdown has been partially lifted and insurance falls under essential services, agents don&rsquo;t have access to public transport. Also, resident welfare associations are not allowing entry of agents,&rdquo; said the head of channel sales at a private insurer.  The June quarter is usually the slowest month as far as life insurance sales are concerned. Policy sales start picking from the onset of the festive season and shows the maximum growth during the fourth quarter.  &amp;amp;nbsp;

Buy SBI Life Insurance Company; target of Rs 1197: Dolat Capital Dolat Capital is bullish on SBI Life Insurance Company has recommended buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1197 in its research report dated July 22, 2020. Dolat Capital's research report on SBI Life Insurance Company SBILIFE reported a strong 14% growth in GWP primarily driven by strong renewal collections (~30% YoY) which made up 60% of total premiums collected. Although APE fall was 31% YoY, NBP decline was minimal at 3% YoY highlighting the strong franchise and ability to outperform industry in adverse market conditions. Performance in Individual Protection, however, was weaker than peers (-36% YoY) primarily due to reduced agency performance (-31% APE YoY). Despite the muted credit growth environment, SBILIFE saw only a 10% decline in group protection as it was able to sell to existing home loan customers of SBI bank. Non-par portfolio continued to show momentum, growing 28% QoQ, with customers preferring guaranteed products which were offered at higher IRRs due to the company&rsquo;s inability to re-price. Product mix between savings and protection stayed constant sequentially resulting in a 6.2% YoY increase in VNB margin. Thi increase was offset by lower risk free rate to the tune of 4.2% resulting in a VNB margin of 18.7%.

Four sectors, 20 stocks that look attractive after June quarter earnings Even management commentary gave the market a confident outlook to withstand businesses against the COVID spread and its impact. Prashanth Tapse  Looking beyond and after June quarter earnings, investors are now flocking to virus-resilient sectors in the market. And despite COVID-19 severely hampering economic activity, markets consistently surged on better-than-expected June quarter earnings and on hopes of COVID-19 vaccine. Indian investor sentiment was also boosted by domestic liquidity, which continued to drive Indian equities in tandem with global markets.  Even management commentary gave the market a confident outlook to withstand businesses against the COVID spread and its impact. With unlocking formulas supporting phased re-opening of economic activity, market started discounting the severity of impact of virus spread over businesses, going forward. But it seems like more businesses are dealing with coronavirus and markets have learnt to live with it.  Here are sectors which we believe investors should focus on and invest in after June quarter earnings session:  Life Insurance a sweet spot sector: Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) clocked a sharp 40 percent month-on-month growth in individual premiums in July and August, led by a jump in the sales of big-ticket pension and term assurance plans. We believe life insurance space in India has been gaining significant traction, with top private sector players delivering strong performances over the past two to three years. We expect private insurance companies like HDFC Life, SBI Life and ICICI Prudential Life could see the same traction in premium collection growth.  Defence sector stocks to be in action on the back of Atma Nirbhar Bharat boost: The procurements will focus on indigenous design and development. Platforms and equipment worth Rs 31,130 crore will be procured from Indian companies and they will be manufactured in India. In the last 5 years, India has spent Rs 3.5 trillion on import of defence items and expects the opportunities of Rs 4 trillion in next 5 years, hence defence stocks like Bharat Dynamics, Bharat Electronics, ZenTech, Cochin Shipyard, HAL and L&amp;amp;amp;T are set to benefit.  The real estate sector can see a boost in the coming quarter: The Centre makes a countrywide effort to push affordable housing and Maharashtra is considering reducing stamp duty on real estate from 5 percent to 2-3 percent in order to give a boost to the industry. The government recently appointed a committee, under the chairmanship of HDFC head Deepak Parekh, to make recommendations to boost the sector. One of its recommendations was to cut stamp duty by 50 percent. Realty &amp;amp;amp; building material stocks to be focused in coming quarters. We like Kolte-Patil, Godrej Properties, Sobha, Brigade Enterprises, Raymond, Ashiana Housing etc. Paints /Tiles stocks are also to follow the trend.  Government's move to build a better infrastructure sector: National Infrastructure Pipeline will ease COVID hit on the economy. Government has identified about 7,000 projects in different sectors that will be part of the National Infrastructure Pipeline. The National Infrastructure Pipeline will play a crucial role in resurrecting the country's economy from the impact of the corona outbreak and the country is going to spend more than Rs 100 lakh crore on this. Hence we are bullish on stocks such as Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro, Ashoka buildcon, Dilip Buildcon, KEC International and KNR Construction.  The author is AVP Research at Mehta Equities.

COVID-19 impact | Life and health insurance becoming a dominant need: SBI Life survey A survey by SBI Life Insurance in partnership with Nielsen showed that 80 percent (8 out of 10) Indians believe that buying life insurance is key. Buying a life insurance or a health insurance has become a dominant need for Indian customers in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, a survey has found.  The survey by SBI Life Insurance in partnership with Nielsen showed that 80 percent (8 out of 10) Indians believe that buying life insurance is key.  Similarly, 75 percent (7 out of 10) who don&rsquo;t have a critical illness health plan are planning to buy it within the next three months. This is to help address the rising medical costs and financial burden on the family due to rise in ailments like COVID-19, amongst others.  The survey was conducted among 2,435 people across the country.  Ravi Krishnamurthy, president-zone 1, SBI Life Insurance said health has been a key focus among Indian customers ever since the pandemic broke out.  &ldquo;There is a clear spike in searches for term plans and health products. The industry will benefit due to the rising awareness for the products,&rdquo; he added.  While he did not specify the number of coronavirus death claims settled so far by the company, Krishnamurthy said there is a priority given to settle COVID-19 claims.  The survey showed that while life insurance followed by health insurance are the top-most financial products bought with an intention to safeguard the family&rsquo;s future.  The allied financial costs related to COVID-19 treatment are also a key factor in purchase of health insurance. SBI Life&rsquo;s survey showed that 53 percent of Indians are not financially prepared to bear the cost of COVID-19 treatment.  IRDAI chairman Subhash Khuntia had earlier said so far a total of 2,38,160 COVID-19 health claims have been filed. Of these, 1,48,298 claims worth Rs 1,430 crore have been settled.  Moneycontrol had reported earlier that despite several thousand COVID-19 deaths, the insurance claims remain low.  A total of 96,318 people have died due to COVID-19 in India. There are 61,45,292 reported positive COVID-19 cases in the country.  Going forward, Krishnamuthy said the proposed standard term plan would help in making the product simpler and helping customers to purchase a plain vanilla protection plan.  Term plan or pure protection plan pays an insurance claim if the policyholder dies during the policy term.  General insurers have also launched&nbsp;specific health insurance products - Corona Kavach and Corona Rakshak- to cater to the need arising out of the coronavirus pandemic.

Hot Stocks | SBI, UBL two buy calls for short term, sell on Grasim; here's why As far as levels are concerned, the base has shifted higher and the previous resistance area of 11,700&ndash; 11,450 should now be treated as strong support.   We have seen a spectacular comeback by the bulls after the recent fall towards 10,800.  In the week gone by, the market just took off with the help of a few heavyweights.  Initially, it was the IT space that took the charge and lifted markets higher from the critical levels along with some participation from the banking space.  Any robust rally in the market is incomplete without the contribution of the banking space. Last Friday, post the RBI policy, banking stocks attracted tremendous buying interest to eventually end the week at a new seven-month high for Nifty above the 11,900-mark.  In the last couple of weeks&rsquo; rally, global markets played a major part as we are seeing some gravity-defying moves despite some in-between uncertainty.  The way Nifty surpassed the August 31 high of 11,794 with some authority and it is now within the kissing distance of 12,000, the positivity is likely to extend further.  Importantly, the banking space has some dominance which is very much in favour of the bulls. It may provide an impetus for the extended rally.  Now, the only missing factor is the participation from the broader market.  If we look at the Nifty Midcap index, in the last 7-8 sessions, they remained muted throughout and only a handful of heavyweight names lifted the market higher.  Hence, if the Midcap index breaks out from the recent congestion, it will be considered as a healthy rally.  As far as levels are concerned, the base has shifted higher and the previous resistance area of 11,700&ndash; 11,450 should now be treated as strong support.  On the flip side, we are very much close to the psychological mark of 12,000. The moment it is taken out, we may see a steady move towards 12,200&ndash;12,400 levels.  Since the banking index is back to 200-day SMA on the daily chart and the way it closed with a complete gush in the space, a move beyond 24,000 would provide strong support to the benchmark index.  However, we would like to highlight that since the move is extremely swift, we can see some intraday profit-booking anytime and hence, one needs to position accordingly and be very fussy in stock-selection.  Here are two buy and one sell call for this week:  State Bank Of India (SBI) | Buy | LTP: Rs 198.55 | Target price: Rs 208 - 212 | Stop loss: Rs 192 | Upside: 7%  Last Friday, we had a stupendous move in the banking conglomerates and the most underperforming PSU banking space, too, participated aggressively in it.  SBI, being the giant and trusted PSB of the lot, has managed to break out after a long phase of consolidation.  Due to the tail-end surge, the stock prices managed to traverse the 89-EMA on the daily chart with sizable volumes.  In addition, we can witness a positive crossover in the combination of 5 and 20 EMA which indicates the possibility of an up-move this week.  United Breweries (UBL) | Buy | LTP: Rs 991 | Target price: Rs 1,035 | Stop loss: Rs 964 | Upside: 4%  As we stepped into &lsquo;Unlock 5.0&rsquo;, the government eased a lot of restrictions on restaurants and bars. Hence, the liquor stocks saw some buying traction post this development.  Recently, UBL had undergone some selling over the past few weeks and after a brief pause, we witnessed a sudden spike in the stock prices.  If we look at the volume activity, we are seeing a decent rise, providing credence to the move.  This may not be the complete trend reversal but at least we can see a short-term bounce in the stock. Hence, we recommend going long for a target of Rs.1035 in the coming days. The stop loss can be placed at Rs.964  Grasim Industries | Sell | LTP: Rs 749.60 | Target price: Rs 715 | Stop loss: Rs 773 | Downside: 5%  In the last couple of weeks, the entire cement space had a stellar move and Grasim being the holding company of cement giant Ultratech Cement, did not move to the tune of it.  This sluggishness finally resulted in a profit-booking last Friday and despite the benchmark hitting a new seven-month high, this stock had a weak close.  The daily chart now resembles a &lsquo;Hanging Man&rsquo; pattern (formed on Thursday), which got confirmed on a closing basis as well.  Looking at these observations, we expect the stock to underperform and witness further profit-booking in the forthcoming week.  Hence, momentum traders can look to sell on a bounce around Rs 752-755 for a target of Rs 715 in the coming days.

With the backing of ArcelorMittal, Nippon Steel, AM/NS charts a new growth plan in India Talking to Moneycontrol, CEO Dilip Oommen said that AM/NS (formerly Essar Steel) may diversify into long steel. He also commented on the company's interest in Uttam Galva Steels With two parents that produce 10 percent of the world&rsquo;s steel and have access to the latest technology, ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India is going through a transformation across its product portfolio, key functions, and even a new office that is in the works in Mumbai.  One of the biggest changes for the company, which was earlier known as Essar Steel, will be diversifying into making long steel that is used in construction and infrastructure industries. Ever since it was set up in 1998, the steelmaker has specialised in making flat steel that is used by auto and white goods companies.  &ldquo;We have an eye on long products in India,&rdquo; Dilip Oommen, CEO, ArcelorMittal&nbsp;Nippon&nbsp;Steel India (AM/NS), told Moneycontrol. The company is in talks with two state governments to buy land, to set up a new facility. Oommen declined to share more details, saying the plans are on the drawing board.  The present facility in Hazira, Gujarat, is one of the biggest standalone units in the world making flat steel. It has an annual capacity to make 10 million tons of steel.  A diversification into long steel is understandable as the 2017 National Steel Policy points out that nearly 60 percent of the metal's consumption will come from construction and infrastructure sectors by 2030, up from 40 percent. AM/NS will square up against the industry leaders, Tata Steel and JSW Steel, who dominate the segment at present.  Both ArcelorMittal - the world's largest steelmaker - and Nippon Steel, Japan's biggest, are major producers of long steel. The two steelmakers had come together to bid for Essar Steel, which was admitted to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The joint venture was declared the new owner in December 2019.  At the time, the company had announced that it plans to increase AM/NS's capacity to 12 million tons to 15 million tons per year in the long run.  &ldquo;Apart from the huge volumes that they produce, between the two of them, ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel also make some of the most high-end steel products in the industry...it's the best thing that could have happened,&amp;quot; says Oommen, of the change in ownership.  The expansion sits well with the vision of LN Mittal, Chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal, who had for long wanted to set up mega facilities in his home country. But his much-hoped project in Odisha got stuck and was shelved. Through AM/NS, he now has the opportunity to expand in a market where demand for steel - despite the current problems from COVID-19 - is expected to grow among the fastest in the world. In most of the other regions in the world, ArcelorMittal is re-looking at its capacity and has even pruned in some.  Product portfolio to expand  Explaining on the scope to expand the company's present product&nbsp;basket, including both long and flat products, Oommen said many of the specialised steel that is currently imported, can be produced locally.  &amp;quot;India imports line pipes. Also, a lot of high value steel used in the auto sector is also imported, so is electrical steel. All this can be substituted and produced in India,&amp;quot; said Oommen, who has been&nbsp;with the company since 2003.    &amp;quot;Our offerings will go up, and several products will be launched. The COVID-19 pandemic has delayed things by a bit. But it will again gain speed,&amp;quot; said the steel veteran who has been in the industry for 37 years.  On the impact of the virus, Oommen said that the company may not match last year's output, which was 7.23 million tons. This year, it could be lower by about 4 lakh tons. The company, which had cut down on its production to the bare minimum post the nationwide lockdown in end-March, had brought it back to full capacity by the mid of May.  &amp;quot;Our&nbsp; EBITDA, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and ammortisation, will be much better in the third quarter,&amp;quot; Oommen said.  AM/NS, like ArcelorMittal, follows a calendar year.&nbsp; In the second quarter, its EBITDA fell by 23.5 percent to $107 million&nbsp;in&nbsp;the quarter ending June 30 from $140 million in the&nbsp;previous&nbsp;quarter. Steel production was down 29 percent to 1.2 million tonnes, as compared to 1.7 million tonnes in the first quarter.  &amp;quot;Certain segments have shown good improvement. These include the passenger vehicles&nbsp; and tractors. Commercial vehicles is an area of concern,&amp;quot; Oommen said on the demand outlook.  Interest in Uttam Galva Steels  During its bid for Essar Steel, ArcelorMittal had paid over Rs 6,500 crore to clear the debt of Uttam Galva Steels, in which it had bought a stake in 2009. The world's largest steelmaker had made the payment to qualify to bid for Essar Steel, as&nbsp;under insolvency laws, promoters of defaulting companies were barred from placing bids.  Uttam Galva was again in news recently when its lead lender State Bank of India took the company to the NCLT.  While Oommen didn't specifically comment, he said AM/NS is interested in &amp;quot;any project that will add value,&amp;quot; and that &amp;quot;it will follow due process under NCLT.&amp;quot;  New corporate building  AM/NS, after the ownership change, moved into a new corporate office in Mumbai. By all accounts it will be a temporary one.  Oommen said the company plans to have a new building that will house its India headquarters. The new office will be made of steel, much like what ArceloMittal is building in Luxembourg. The new world headquarters will use 6,000 tons of steel.  The India office may take some more time as further details are being finalised.

Buy SBI Life Insurance Company; target of Rs 1018: Dolat Capital Market Dolat Capital Market is bullish on SBI Life Insurance Company has recommended buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1018 in its research report dated October 27, 2020. Dolat Capital Market's research report on SBI Life Insurance Company SBILIFE reported a 28% YoY increase in GWP to Rs. 130.9bn in Q2FY21 driven by strong renewal premium and single premium, which grew 28% and 71% respectively to Rs 71.5bn and Rs 36.2bn. APE declined 3.5% YoY to Rs. 27.1bn but more than doubled sequentially. The savings APE declined 9.2% to Rs. 23.7bn while the protection APE grew 70% to Rs. 3.4bn. We expect SBILIFE&rsquo;s APE growth to be on par with the industry&rsquo;s. Individual savings APE declined 15% YoY to Rs. 21.1bn and comprise of 78% of the overall mix (Q2FY20: 88% Q1FY21: 75%). Although ULIP APE continued to decline (-13% YoY), the product has seen some recovery visible in the strong sequential performance which is aided by the larger share of debt. Par and non-par also declined 17% and 25% YoY respectively in Q2FY21. We expect retail savings to decline 5-10% in FY21.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on SBI Life Insurance Company SBI Life delivered 28% YoY growth in GWP mainly from renewal &amp;amp;amp; single premium, while some recovery in regular premiums. This has led to APE recovery with de-growth of -4%/-15% YoY in Q2/H1FY21 vis-&agrave;-vis -32% YoY de-growth in Q1FY21. New business was driven by group savings, protection and recovery in ULIP. This change in business mix kept the margins steady at 18.8% (PLe of 19.6%) as recovery in ULIP offset the protection margin benefit. Improving protection mix and other higher margin products will help it deliver margins of 19-20% by FY22-23E and see strong recovery in business momentum.

L&amp;amp;T in talks with SBI, Telangana government to bail out cash-strapped Hyderabad metro rail project The Telangana government, however, has its own fiscal challenges due to the loss of tax revenue on account of Covid-19, a high debt burden and the recent floods that devastated capital city Hyderabad and its adjoining districts  Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro (L&amp;amp;amp;T), operator of the Hyderabad metro rail project, said it is in discussions with State Bank of India (SBI) and the Telangana government to make the project financially viable.  &ldquo;There is huge finance involved; there are other aspects involved. We are in constant dialogue with the government of Telangana and (lead banker) SBI to see what is best from a financial point of view to refinance the project and make it viable,&rdquo; said SN Subrahmanyan, CEO &amp;amp;amp; MD of L&amp;amp;amp;T, during the company&rsquo;s post-earnings media call on Wednesday.  Subrahmanyan said he was assured by Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao that the State would do what is required to get the metro rail project back on track.  &ldquo;We are cautiously optimistic that better sense will prevail. This being a huge investment, the government also considers it as their project,&rdquo; the L&amp;amp;amp;T boss added.  A matter of interest  Subrahmanyan declined to comment on the specific financial assistance he was seeking from the government, but hinted it had to do with compensating for the interest incurred.  &ldquo;It is nothing but the interest loss; the project has got nearly Rs 14,000 crore of debt, and therefore the loss is about Rs 1,400 crore, which is nothing but the interest cost,&rdquo; Subrahmanyan said.  &ldquo;Otherwise, if the traffic is normal and such, the project breaks even at the EBITDA level. We have to find ways and means to reduce the debt level, thereby bringing the project to more viable levels,&rdquo; Subrahmanyan added.  Hyderabad metro rail is L&amp;amp;amp;T&rsquo;s single biggest investment in a project. It has invested over Rs 19,000 crore on the project through debt, equity and a grant from the Central government.  Covid impact L&amp;amp;amp;T fully commissioned the Hyderabad metro rail project in February 2020. In March it saw a daily ridership of 500,000 people. Operations came to a grinding halt towards the end of March due to the nationwide lockdown imposed to contain Covid-19.  After being fully shut for over five months, the metro rail began partial operations on September 7. Operations are being resumed in a graded manner. Ridership has only reached 100,000 on a daily basis, as many commuters are keeping away from the metro, fearing a Covid-19 infection, and this is making the recovery all the more challenging.  While the lockdown had put the brakes on operations and cash flows, L&amp;amp;amp;T continued to incur fixed operational costs, depreciation and interest expenses. All this raised serious questions on the financial viability of the project, which is also burdening L&amp;amp;amp;T&rsquo;s balance sheet at the consolidated level.  In the first half of FY21, the Hyderabad metro managed to make only Rs 550 crore, way below the costs it incurs. Indeed, L&amp;amp;amp;T Hyderabad Metro Rail suffered a net loss of Rs 382 crore in FY20. Total revenues stood at Rs 1,370 crore.  Tricky time  Moneycontrol had earlier reported&nbsp;about the possibility of L&amp;amp;amp;T threatening to invoke the &lsquo;force majeure&rsquo; clause in the concession agreement to walk out of the project in the case of unforeseen events.  But things are more complicated on the ground, as the Telangana government finds itself in a tough fiscal situation due to the loss of tax revenue on account of Covid-19, a high debt burden and the recent floods that devastated capital city Hyderabad and its adjoining districts.  The company is also weighing other options, including monetising land banks that it received as part of the concessionaire agreement, and even a possible divestment.  But the timing hasn't been right for L&amp;amp;amp;T, given how the Covid-19 pandemic has hit real estate demand, especially for commercial and office space, as employers have adopted the work from home option. This has also led to a decline in the number of daily commuters.

ICICI Direct's research report on SBI Life Insurance SBI Life Insurance reported a healthy set of numbers led by strong renewal premium and investment income.

Hot Stocks | Can buy LIC Housing Finance, Delta Corp and SBI Life for short term On the technical front, 12,750 and 29,500 would act as an immediate hurdle for Nifty and Bank Nifty, respectively.   Indian markets closed at record high on November 10 on the back of strong global cues.  So far, Nifty has surged more than 8 percent this month while Bank Nifty has gained nearly 19 percent as uncertainty over the US elections ended along with development in the COVID vaccine.  Banking and financial stocks surged sharply with Bajaj and HDFC twins among top gainers.  On the derivatives front, the rally was supported by short-covering, done by call writers at 12,400 and 12,500 strikes.  Furthermore, put writers added hefty open interest at 12,400 strikes and seen shifting at higher bands.  On the technical front, 12,750 and 29,500 would act as an immediate hurdle for Nifty and Bank Nifty, respectively.  However, secondary oscillators suggest that the market is a bit overheated now and traders should expect volatility in the coming sessions.  On the downside, 12,400 would act as strong support for Nifty with bias likely to remain in favour of bulls.  We advise traders to use any dip to create fresh longs. For Bank Nifty, the 28,000-27,500 zone is a strong support area.  Here are three buy calls for the next 2-3 weeks:  LIC Housing Finance | LTP: Rs 323.50 | Target price: Rs 353 | Stop loss: Rs 293 | Upside: 9%  For the last nearly ten weeks, the stock has been consolidating in a broader range of Rs 280-320 along with consistent buying around support levels.  On the daily charts, the stock is holding well above its short and long-term moving averages.  This week, the stock has managed to give a price volume breakout above its 200-days exponential moving average on the daily charts and also succeeded to close above the key resistance level of Rs 320 after a prolonged consolidation.  Delta Corp | LTP: Rs 119.50 | Target price: Rs 132 | Stop loss: Rs 108 | Upside: 10%  The stock has given a sharp rally from Rs 85 to Rs 115 in August 2020 and after that, it went into consolidation as prices were seen fluctuating in the range of Rs 100 to Rs 120 levels.  This week, the stock has managed to give consolidation breakout above the 200-day exponential moving average on a daily timeframe and also managed to close above it.  The positive divergences on secondary oscillators suggest further up-move in the prices as the breakout is well supported by additionally higher volumes.  SBI Life Insurance Company | LTP: Rs 831 | Target price: Rs 902 | Stop loss: Rs 775 | Upside: 9%  For the last three months, the stock has been consistently moving lower in a downward sloping channel with the formation of the lower high and lower bottom patterns.  However, this week the stock has once again moved back above its short-term moving averages with a breakout above the falling trend line of the sloping channel.  The breakout can be seen with rising volumes and positive divergences on secondary oscillators.

DHFL promoter Kapil Wadhawan moves NCLT seeking participation in CoC meeting, access to data Earlier, Kapil Wadhawan had requested the RBI-appointed administrator that he should be allowed to participate in the next meeting of the CoC so that he could 'put forth some of these thoughts to the CoC on the video conference to constructively aid in the resolution process of DHFL'. Kapil Wadhawan, promoter of crisis-ridden mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL), has moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking participation in the committee of creditors' (CoC) meeting to be part of the discussions for finding a bidder.  Wadhawan has filed a petition in the Mumbai NCLT against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)-appointed administrator in the matter.  Wadhawan has also requested access to data on DHFL's assets.  So far, there is no clarity on the bidding process for the troubled lender which was caught in a series of alleged financial irregularities.  Lenders to DHFL are likely to call for another round of bids, seeking higher value for its assets.  The bidders to DHFL include Adani Group, Piramal Enterprises, US-based Oaktree, and Hong Kong-based SC Lowy.  SC Lowy had submitted 10-70 percent higher price for either a stake in the company or buying out some of its assets.  Oaktree Capital has raised its bid price for the entire portfolio to Rs 33,000 crore from Rs 27,800 crore earlier.  There is a possibility that lenders may seek fresh bids seeking higher value.  Earlier, in a letter to administrator on November 11, Wadhawan had requested the RBI-appointed administrator to allow him to participate in the next meeting of the CoC so that he could &ldquo;put forth some of these thoughts to the CoC on the video conference to constructively aid in the resolution process of DHFL&rdquo;.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m presently handicapped as I have no access to the records of the company to ascertain the present position, and I&rsquo;m constrained to rely on the newspaper reports as well as my knowledge and experience of having run the business for more than 15 years,&rdquo; Wadhawan said.  If given access to the records, he can make a proposal setting out the necessary upfront and deferred payment components, which will provide maximum value realization for all stakeholders, Wadhawan said.  DHFL is the first financial services company which has been sent to the NCLT under the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC).  In his letter, Wadhawan repeated his offer to pay up the entire principal amount to all creditors without any haircut, besides letting all creditors convert part of their debt to equity.  &ldquo;Even today, I am willing to stand by the principle of 100 percent repayment of principal amounts to all the creditors without any hair cut as I do believe, from DHFL&rsquo;s business, that such recovery is possible,&rdquo; Wadhawan said in the letter.  DHFL is facing claims of Rs 87,031 crore from financial creditors.  Its large lenders include State Bank of India (including SBI Singapore) with Rs 10,083 crore exposure, Bank of India Rs 4,125 crore, Canara Bank Rs 2,681 crore, NHB Rs 2,434 crore, Union Bank of India Rs 2,378 crore, Syndicate Bank Rs 2,229 crore, and Bank of Baroda Rs 2,075 crore, Indian Bank Rs 1,552 crore, Central Bank Rs 1,389 crore, IDBI Bank Rs 999 crore, and HDFC Bank Rs 361 crore.  DHFL posted a net loss of Rs 2,122.65 crore in the quarter ended September, 2020, as compared with a net loss of Rs 6,640.62 crore in the corresponding quarter in the previous year.  It had posted a profit of Rs 70 crore in the first quarter.  Total assets of the company stand at Rs 83,638 crore as of September-end, compared with Rs 85,926.95 crore in the March quarter. Total liabilities stood at Rs 91,250.13 crore in the September quarter as against Rs 91,326.19 crore in the preceding quarter, the company informed exchanges on November 26.  In the results note, auditors said the company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern depends upon the outcome of the ongoing corporate insolvency resolution process.

 HDFC Bank outage | Working on war footing to strengthen IT infrastructure, will comply with RBI... The RBI has asked HDFC Bank to temporarily halt sourcing new credit cards and stop the launch of its digital business-generating activities planned under Digital 2.0 and other proposed business generating IT applications   After the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) temporarily stopped launch of all new digital products of HDFC Bank, its new CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan on December 3 said the bank will comply with the RBI regulations and will wait for the regulator&rsquo;s clearance before launching new products.  &ldquo;We had two outages, one in November 2018 and second in December 2019. We have taken help of external expertise, understood what needs to be done further and have substantially implemented the inputs to strengthen our IT infrastructure and systems,&rdquo; Jagdishan said in a letter to customers.  &ldquo;Unexpectedly another incident happened on November 21,2020, and the primary reason for the same is the power outage in our primary data centre. We are working on war footing to strengthen this area also now,&rdquo; Jagdishan said.  Jagdishan assured customers that there is no reason to worry. &ldquo;You can continue to transact with the bank without any concern,&rdquo; he said.  Jagdishan apologised for the digital outage to customers. &ldquo;We realize that as our valued customer, you expect us to maintain a very high standard of service quality and experience. And sometimes, we have not been able to live up to your expectations. For that, please accept our sincere apologies,&rdquo; the CEO said in the letter.  The RBI asked HDFC Bank to temporarily halt sourcing new credit cards and stop the launch of its digital business-generating activities planned under Digital 2.0 and other proposed business generating IT applications.  The RBI issued the order dated December 2, 2020, to HDFC Bank.  The central bank on November 23 had sought an explanation from HDFC Bank after its digital services faced disruptions on the evening of November 21 till November 22 morning - for over 12 hours.  The order also states that HDFC Bank&rsquo;s board must examine the lapses and fix accountability.  &ldquo;The above measures shall be considered for lifting (the restrictions) upon satisfactory compliance with the major critical observations as identified by the RBI,&rdquo; it added.  New launches after RBI&rsquo;s clearance  Jagdishan said the bank will now launch its digital initiatives after getting the RBI&rsquo;s approvals.  &ldquo;Some of our strategic digital initiatives to improve the front-end digital experience, improve digital origination, straight through processing, next generation of mobile and internet banking, API-based banking on the edge etc would now be readied and launched post the approval and clearance from the regulator,&rdquo; the CEO said in the letter.  Further, the bank will work with experts and the regulator to fortify the identified areas for improvement. &ldquo;Internally, we are looking at this as an opportunity to further improve ourselves and emerge stronger,&rdquo; Jagdishan said.  Banks are under immense pressure because of the competition to come up with new digital banking products, often without proper testing and leading to such failures, said senior bankers. &ldquo;There is intense competition from industry and new players such as payments banks to keep introducing new products. In their anxiety to remain at the top, banks often come with digital banking products that are not fully tested. Banks need to be careful to make sure they have enough technology capabilities to back such products,&rdquo; said Naresh Malhotra, a senior banking consultant.  To be fair, technical glitches aren&rsquo;t limited to HDFC Bank alone. Other banks too have been facing problems on the technical side, with the latest instance reported on State Bank of India&rsquo;s (SBI's) mobile banking application, YONO, in the last two days with customers&nbsp;complaining on Twitter&nbsp;that they are unable to login to the application following an error. This issue has not been resolved yet.  In October, some of the customers of another leading private lender, ICICI Bank too&nbsp;took to social media&nbsp;complaining of issues with the bank&rsquo;s online payment systems and mobile app.

November was weak month for life insurers due to high base, says Kotak Institutional Equities Private life insurers reported a 7 percent year-on-year decline in individual annualised premium equivalent in November 2020. The month of November 2020 was weak for the life insurance business due to a high base, said a report by Kotak Institutional Equities.&nbsp;As per the report,&nbsp;private life insurers&nbsp;posted a 7 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in individual annualised premium equivalent (APE) in November 2020.  APE refers to 100 percent of regular premiums collected and 10 percent of single premium collection.  The report said the APE increase of 14 percent YoY in October 2020 was on the back of a high base.    The country's largest insurer Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) reported high growth of 104 percent in individual APE during November 2019 due to sunset period of some of its key policies. On this high base, LIC reported 54 percent&nbsp;decline in November 2020.  Among private insurers, HDFC Life, Max Life and Tata AIA performed better than the industry while ICICI Prudential Life and Aditya Birla Sun Life were weak.  Other insurers like SBI Life and Bajaj Allianz Life were broadly in line with industry averages. The Kotak report said that equity mutual funds reported sharp outflows likely due to profit booking.    Among the different business segments, the share of single premium dropped to 47 percent in November 2020 from 50 percent in October 2020. The Kotak report said the marginal decline in share of single premiums likely&nbsp;indicates some moderation in pace of growth of annuity or lump sum payout products.    In the group business, the private players&rsquo; market share in group business was broadly flat&nbsp;month-on-month&nbsp;at 24 percent in November&nbsp;2020. Among major private players, Bajaj Life, HDFC Life and SBI Life lost marginal market share in group business on a month-on-month basis while it increased for Aditya Birla Sun Life and ICICI&nbsp;Prudential Life.

Vijay Mallya applies for funds held by UK court from sale of French property Mallya's counsel, Philip Marshall, had argued that his client needed urgent access to the substantial funds held by the court to cover his living and legal expenses, as had already been set out by a validation order of the High Court from last year. Liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya on&nbsp;December 11 made an urgent application before the UK High Court seeking access to millions of pounds to cover his living expenses and legal fees from funds held with the Court Funds Office as part of bankruptcy proceedings, initiated by a consortium of Indian banks led by the State Bank of India.  Deputy Insolvency and Companies Court Judge Robert Schaffer declined to allow a draw down from the court-held funds of an estimated amount of around 1.5 million pounds, accrued from the sale of Mallya's French luxury property Le Grand Jardin earlier this year, until further arguments in the case. However, he did allow the release of 240,000 pounds plus VAT to cover the legal costs of a substantive hearing in the bankruptcy proceedings scheduled for next Friday.  In essence, I will adjourn this hearing subject to one caveat that the fees for the hearing next week are covered, concluded Judge Schaffer, during a hearing held remotely on Friday. Mallya's counsel, Philip Marshall, had argued that his client needed urgent access to the substantial funds held by the court to cover his living and legal expenses, as had already been set out by a validation order of the High Court from last year.  Unless the court grants a validation order, prospectively or retrospectively, any payments made whilst a bankruptcy petition is pending are void. With ongoing proceedings in India and the UK, Dr Mallya cannot wait for something to live on and to cover his legal expenses. With substantial sums outstanding [to lawyers] and no other source of income, it is absurd to refuse, argued Marshall, warning that without the money Mallya would not have any legal representation for the important hearing next week.  That would put him at a very serious disadvantage and be a denial of justice, he said. The court heard that 64-year-old Mallya's income from two consultancy agreements was no longer coming in and therefore he had to resort to the money derived from the sale of his French property, which was deposited with the court as a convenient place to put the money.  Barrister Marcia Shekerdemian, arguing on behalf of SBI and others in the class action, disputed the grounds of the urgent application as being based on a pre-approved 2019 court validation order. The [2019] order dealt with payments out of his [Mallya's] income. This [application] is referring to payments out of capital assets, which is a very different animal, said Shekerdemian.  It is a substantial portion of his admitted UK assets and even on a limited urgency basis, cannot be approved, she said, accusing Mallya of trying to jump the queue to gain access to the funds before the substantive hearing in the bankruptcy case next week. The SBI-led consortium of 13 Indian banks, which also includes Bank of Baroda, Corporation Bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu &amp;amp;amp; Kashmir Bank, Punjab &amp;amp;amp; Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co. Pvt Ltd, had initiated the proceedings against Mallya in December 2018.  There have been a series of hearings in the case since then as part of their efforts to recoup around GBP 1.145 billion in unpaid loans. Mallya, meanwhile, remains on bail as the UK Home Office deals with a confidential legal issue before UK Home Secretary Priti Patel can sign off on his extradition sought by the Indian government, on charges of fraud and money laundering related to loans acquired by his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.  The separate extradition proceedings have gone through different levels of legal procedure in the UK courts and concluded that he has a case to answer before the Indian courts.

SBI will prefer co-origination models of lending to MSMEs: Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara said the country's largest lender will be happy to deal with the intermediary players in the financing business and may be &amp;quot;we can help such intermediary players by buying out their portfolio also&amp;quot;. State Bank of India (SBI) will prefer the co-origination model to cater to the financing needs of MSMEs and collaboration with fintechs is a good idea as it helps in assessing the risk profile of the borrower in a better manner, its chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara said on Saturday.  Pointing out that the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are constrained today in terms of cash flows, time gap in realising receivables, among others and also the level of lenders' confidence in funding them, Khara said collaborating is a better model than lending directly to MSMEs.  &amp;quot;The fact of the matter is that today not many NBFCs have come in this space. And of late, when it comes to finding solutions, we feel that apart from lending directly to the MSMEs, there is a way forward in terms of collaborating with these NBFCs along with the biggest fintechs who have the ability to process the structured and unstructured (financial) data to have a better sense in terms of assessment of risk,&amp;quot; Khara said.  Based on that assessment, he said, bankers feel very comfortable in lending to the MSMEs.  He was speaking at a webinar on financing the unfinanced organised by the Global Alliance for Mass Entrepreneurship (GAME).  There could also be another option of financing based on the cash flow and not on the basis of balance sheet because very often it is observed that the balance sheet and the financial statement are not available in a form which is expected by any banker, he added.  Also, there is a broad spectrum of MSMEs in the country which work in a host of areas and often the kind of financial information coming from them is not very organised, Khara explained.  So to the extent where the data is fully organised, which is more like any other large corporate, it is the kind of spectrum which SBI is engaging with, he said.  &amp;quot;So for different levels of maturity of MSMEs, the comfort level with the bank also differs. If at all they are part of the ecosystem for a large industry major, it becomes all the more easier for the banks to get the information structured vis-a-vis unstructured relating to the (financial) dealings (of the borrower).  &amp;quot;And those who are essentially in the nano category, may be say up to Rs 2 crore or so (turnover), there we actually tend to leverage upon various fintechs who are engaging with these MSMEs. So we would rather collaborate with such fintechs and do the co-origination model (of lending),&amp;quot; Khara said.  He further said that SBI is looking at this kind of a spectrum in financing the small businesses.  &amp;quot;So this is the kind of spectrum and this is how we actually intend to operate. It may not be out of place to mention that many of the MSMEs are still having lots of business done on cash.  &amp;quot;So I think that is posing a major challenge because it is not really giving enough insight into their (financial) behaviour and naturally it is not giving any insight into their turnover,&amp;quot; said the SBI chairman.  He said the country's largest lender will be happy to deal with the intermediary players in the financing business and may be &amp;quot;we can help such intermediary players by buying out their portfolio also&amp;quot;.  The recently launched scheme where banks can also finance some kind of sweat equity is also another option, he added.  &amp;quot;So I think we have got the whole gamut of solutions which are available, but all said and done so as the equity is concerned I think that is something, the sweat equity, which is something wanted by the MSMEs to bring in. Of course in the recent past a new scheme has been introduced where we can also finance some kind of sweat equity also, but that is just the beginning,&amp;quot; Khara said.  He said banks need to have enough confidence into various models of the MSMEs and also the commitment level of such entrepreneurs.  Only then perhaps it will enhance the comfort for any bank and they will be in a position to support the sweat equity kind of requirements, said the SBI chairman.

He said banks need to have enough confidence into various models of the MSMEs and also the commitment level of such entrepreneurs.  Only then perhaps it will enhance the comfort for any bank and they will be in a position to support the sweat equity kind of requirements, said the SBI chairman.

Need to have DFIs back into arena, says SBI MD Ashwani Bhatia ICICI and IDBI in previous avatar were DFIs and even the country's oldest financial institution IFCI Ltd acted as DFI.   There is need for a development finance institution (DFI) for funding long-term needs of the infrastructure sector, State Bank of India managing director Ashwani Bhatia said on December 12.  The government is actively considering setting up a DFI to meet the financing need of infrastructure sector which according to National Infrastructure Pipeline report requires a massive funding of Rs 111 lakh crore over the next five-year period ending 2024-25.  &amp;quot;My short answer would be yes,&amp;quot; Bhatia said to a question if the time has come to relook at setting up a DFI in India. &amp;quot;State Bank of India was a working capital bank in the 80s and 90s. We were pretty much the gold standard. ICICI and IDBI and other got the complete project and then moved on from there. We would love to have DFIs back into the arena,&amp;quot; he said at a virtual conference organised by Ficci.  ICICI and IDBI in previous avatar were DFIs and even the country's oldest financial institution IFCI Ltd acted as DFI. On Friday Economic Affairs Secretary Tarun Bajaj said DFI like entity is needed and there would be some good progress on that front in the months to come.  Bajaj had said the government has created a debt platform in the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) for which there was a Cabinet announcement. &amp;quot;The Government of India is committed to giving Rs 6,000 crores in the next two years&hellip;that would be leveraged with debt by NIIF and we will be putting in more than Rs 1 lakh crore into infrastructure sector on the debt side &hellip;other than the equity side.  &amp;quot;While DFI is in the works, we are also taking other steps to ensure that infrastructure spend happens and both debt and equity are taken care of,&amp;quot; he said.  Meanwhile, ICICI Lombard managing director Bhargav Dasgupta said, &amp;quot;If we have to do that model (DFI), we probably have to take some of the learnings of the past.&amp;quot;  Speaking at the event, Sanjay Nayar, Partner and CEO of KKR India, said the country cannot become Aatmanirbhar only on foreign capital but need huge amount of domestic capital as well. &amp;quot;The government can play an important role by having some very unique and very focused local sovereign fund that can catalyse foreign capital to come behind it. I think NIIF is a great example. A few more of those targeted towards SMEs, MSMEs, equity, debt are absolutely critical,&amp;quot; Nayyar said.

CHART | More agencies upgrade India&rsquo;s FY21 GDP forecast after Q2 data Four agencies have improved their FY21 GDP forecast for India in the past one week or so. These include Asian Development Bank, State Bank of India, Fitch, and India Ratings. On the back of softer-than-expected economic contraction in the July-September quarter, around 15 major agencies, banks, and research firms have lowered their forecast of negative GDP growth for the full year. Four have done so in the past one week or so. These include Asian Development Bank, State Bank of India, Fitch, and India Ratings. (See chart)  Before that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had also upgraded its GDP forecast to a contraction of 7.5 per cent from 9.5 per cent seen before the July-September GDP print.  Earlier this week, SBI had slashed its contraction forecast to 7.4 per cent from 10.9 per cent. It also forecast a GDP growth of 0.1 per cent for the October-December quarter.  &ldquo;Positive momentum of various economic indicators including RTO transactions, revenue collection at RTO, revenue earning of freight traffic, weekly food arrival, petrol and diesel consumption continued in November. Even our business activity index which is based on high frequency indicators shows improving momentum after a modest decline in the week of Diwali,&rdquo; said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Chief Economic Adviser at SBI.  Ghosh said even as growth outlook had improved, the decline in government expenditure has been quite significant to Rs 3.62 lakh crore in Q2FY21 from Rs 4.86 lakh crore in Q1FY21. The revenue and capital expenditure both declined in Q2 compared to Q1, with larger decline witnessed in revenue expenditure, he said.  A day later ICRA Ltd also improved its growth projections for India, to a 7.8 per cent contraction from 11 per cent seen earlier. It projects a small contraction for October-December at 1 per cent, and a positive growth of 1.3 per cent in January-March.  &ldquo;Subsequently, improving economic fundamentals, a bright outlook for the rabi season, and the visibility of vaccine availability are expected to strengthen demand,&rdquo; said Aditi Nayar, Principal Economist with ICRA Ltd.  &ldquo;The recovery under way in the Indian economy in Q3FY21 is fragile, and appears prone to risks related to rising costs, as well as a re-appearance of supply-side disruptions in some states,&rdquo; Nayar, however, warned.  Nayar said the spending seen during the festive season was driven by pent-up demand, and consumption is yet to fully stabilise in various sectors. While many indicators have displayed growth in the ongoing quarter relative to a weak performance in the same period in FY20, volumes still remain below FY19 levels in a number of sectors, highlighting that a full recovery remains somewhat distant, she said.

SBI extends global trade finance solutions to Israeli corporates &amp;quot;In view of the revival of business activity in the coming months with vaccine approvals being accorded by various governments around the world, we are offering our services/products to the Israeli business community at competitive pricing to meet all their cross border trade finance needs,&amp;quot; B V Ramana said. State Bank of India is offering trade finance solutions and services to Israeli corporates to help them tap business potential arising out of recent Abraham accords leading to normalisation of ties between Israel and Arab states, a bank official said.

Looking to tap into the huge business potential arising out of recent Abraham accords leading to normalisation of ties between Israel and Arab states, the Tel Aviv branch has been reaching out to Israeli exporters.  SBI has substantial presence in the Middle East, and the Gulf region in particular, which may act as an enabler and a catalyst for those looking to immediately engage in trade ties with the corporates in the UAE and Bahrain, Ramana said.  Trade finance solutions package for Israeli corporates includes bill discounting products for exports worldwide, including India, extending supplier's credit/ LC bill discounting, bill discounting based on reimbursement authorisation from LC issuing bank and receivables financing under open account trade.  Other trade related products and services include LC advising, LC confirmation, LC bill collection and bank guarantees.

There is a lot of buzz around the economic potential arising out of the Abraham accords that led to the normalisation of ties between Israel and Arab countries and several delegational visits have already happened between these countries defying COVID-19 pandemic related challenges.  &amp;quot;Having an SBI branch in Israel is a major driver to promoting Israel-India trade relations. More than that, this is a bridge to the Israeli businesses not just to India, but to SBI&rsquo;s presence world wide&amp;quot;, Anat Bernstein-Reich, Chairperson of Israel-India Chamber of Commerce and Vice President of the Israel-Asia Chamber of Commerce told PTI.  Sensing the business opportunity coming out of recent political developments in the region, SBI recently conducted a webinar in association with the bilateral chamber inviting Israeli corporates. It drew significant attention with around 47 participants, including 38 corporates.  SBI's Tel Aviv branch has been operational since 2007 catering to banking requirements of various industries and business segments.

 BNP Paribas Cardiff launches mega share sale in SBI Life Insurance; deal may mark French insurer's exit... On December 4, 2020, Moneycontrol was the first to report that BNP Paribas Cardiff was evaluating the sale of its balance stake in SBI Life Insurance via a block deal. BNP Paribas Cardiff has launched a share sale in SBI Life Insurance which could potentially signal the exit of the French insurance giant from the state-owned insurer and mark the end of a nearly two-decade-old joint venture, sources with knowledge of the matter told Moneycontrol.  SBI Life Insurance was set up in 2001 as a joint venture between State Bank of India and BNP Paribas Cardiff. It debuted on the domestic bourses in October 2017.  On December 4, 2020, Moneycontrol was the first to report that BNP Paribas Cardiff was evaluating the sale of its balance stake in SBI Life Insurance via a block deal.  &ldquo;BNP Paribas has launched the block deal today,&rdquo; an individual told Moneycontrol. A second individual confirmed the same.  According to the current shareholding pattern, the French firm, which falls in the promoter category, holds 5.2 percent stake which is valued at Rs 4,888 crore at current market price. The SBI Life Insurance stock had hit 52-week high earlier this week after registering a strong growth in new business premiums in February.  Both the individuals above spoke to Moneycontrol on the condition of anonymity. Moneycontrol could not immediately connect with BNP Paribas Cardiff and SBI Life Insurance for an immediate comment.  According to the terms of the deal accessed by Bloomberg, BNP Paribas is selling 35 million (or around 3.5 percent) SBI Life Insurance shares which are being offered at Rs 870 to Rs 917 each. This represents a 2.5 percent to 7.5 percent discount to MArch 9&rsquo;s closing price of Rs 940.75.  There is an option to increase the deal size by about 15 million shares (1.5 percent) and BNP Paribas is the sole broker on the deal. If the upsize option is exercised, then BNP Paribas would be left with a miniscule 0.2 percent stake.  The BNP Paribas-SBI Life Saga  BNP Paribas, which is a specialist in personal insurance and had gross written premiums of 29.8 billion euros in 2019 has been gradually paring its stake in SBI Life Insurance over the last few years.

Online sales, contactless underwriting game changer for insurance sector in COVID times Since people are reluctant to venture out of homes, video medical tests are the norm now. There is a questionnaire for potential policy buyers and customers are asked 4-5 COVID- related questions. For COVID-recovered customers, there could be a cooling-off period of 3-6 months. An insurance agent visiting your home/office, getting multiple documents signed and medical tests were the standard operating procedure (SOP) for getting an insurance policy in India. However, a lot has changed now.  From April 2020, after the nationwide lockdown was announced, insurance companies had to quickly devise ways to issue paperless policies without compromising on their underwriting rules.  This led to a slew of changes in the way policies were sold and delivered. Know-Your-Customer (KYC) procedures became completely digitised, COVID-19 related questions gained prominence and medical underwriting happened via video calls.  For COVID-recovered customers, there could be a cooling-off period of 3-6 months, only after which an insurance policy is issued. As reported by Moneycontrol earlier, vaccination certificates could also become a must-have to get a policy and help you get discounts.  COVID-19 questionnaire and test reports  Sachin Dutta, Chief Operating Officer, Canara HSBC OBC Life Life Insurance, said that at the time of onboarding itself, customers are asked 4-5 COVID- related questions.  The questions relate to international travel in the past 2-3 months, duration, purpose and name of destination. Plans and purpose of future travel are also sought.  Dutta said that customers are also asked to disclose if they currently have any flu-like symptoms such as cold, persistent cough, running nose, headache and fever. Those testing positive for COVID-19 have to provide all reports.  Since there were a lot of queries about how to disclose COVID-19 status and whether their claims would be impacted by the virus, insurers are now starting to have standardised forms for disclosure.  Anand Pejawar, President-Operations, IT &amp;amp;amp; International Business, SBI Life Insurance, said that the COVID-specific questionnaire was introduced after the company started getting a lot of queries from on how to disclose their status and how claims would get impacted.  The questions would be around COVID-19, home quarantine and hospitalisation. Details of vaccination and foreign travel also have to be explicitly disclosed.  &ldquo;SBI Life has also formulated guidelines on how to underwrite cases after recovery, and what should be the waiting period. It has served us well as we have been able to take care of the increased demand for insurance in the wake of the pandemic as well as to allay customer fears about policy validity and claim settlements,&rdquo; he added.  Since the vaccination drive from February 2021, customers not wanting to take the vaccine may also find it tough to buy insurance. Those vaccinated with both the shots will find it easier to buy term plans, said industry sources.  Lalitha Bhatia, Chief Operating Officer, Ageas Federal Life Insurance, said that, since April 2020, certain COVID-19-related changes had been implemented in the underwriting guidelines, with the COVID questionnaire becoming a mandatory document at the time of policy purchase.  From January 2021, Bhatia added that the guidelines have been slightly relaxed on account of vaccination, which now forms a part of the COVID questionnaire.  On the non-life side, pre-existing diseases are to be disclosed. The waiting period depends on the age and the policy chosen. Hence those who had undergone treatment for COVID-19 also have to disclose details of hospitalisation and home treatment for medical insurance.  Sanjay Datta, Chief, Underwriting, Claims and Reinsurance, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, said that it would be prudent for customers to declare pre-existing diseases.  &amp;quot;We urge customers to declare if they have received treatment for any condition or symptom(s)/ have undergone hospitalisation for any illness/surgery/ or currently taking medication(s) for any condition or medical procedures. Customers are also urged to declare any diagnostic tests they may have undergone in the past as all these details are significant for our medical team to grade the risk,&rdquo; he added.  Medical tests go digital with lockdown  When it comes to insurance policies, companies would insist on getting a thorough medical check-up to ensure that the pricing of a product is done as per risk norms. Acceptance of an insurance risk is also determined by how healthy an individual is.  Amidst COVID-19 and the resultant lockdown, getting medical tests done was not possible. So that is being replaced by video medical tests.  Pejawar of SBI Life said that, at the company, there are large non-medical limits followed by limits for tele-verifications. Medical tests are not mandatory in a large number of cases, he added.  Telephone-based verification is more common. This is where a medical professional would get on a call with the proposed policyholder and assess his/her health conditions.  Mayank Bathwal, CEO, Aditya Birla Health Insurance, said that pre-policy assessment is made more customer-friendly as they have deployed tele-underwriting. So potential customers need not undergo physical tests for most of the products.  &amp;quot;As a majority of the test centres were closed during lockdown and customers were hesitant to go for medicals, we have waived off medical tests and replaced them with tele-medical underwriting for most of our products. Customers can easily sit in the comfort of their homes and provide us with the required risk- related data,&amp;quot; he added.  At ICICI Lombard, Datta said that medical tests are currently determined on the basis of the customer&rsquo;s age, sum insured opted for and pre-existing illnesses disclosed. It is not mandatory for all new policies.  Some insurers are adopting a wait-and-watch approach. Suresh Agarwal, MD &amp;amp;amp; CEO, Kotak Mahindra General Insurance, said motor business is slowing down while health insurance is growing.  &ldquo;As far as our underwriting practices are concerned, we are yet to make any changes in our approach like mandatory pre-medicals. The rise in claims cost needs to be looked at from a portfolio level rather than policy level. We are monitoring the situation and will take an appropriate call as it progresses,&rdquo; he added.  Medical insurance claims worth Rs 9,000 crore have been settled so far by non-life insurers. Life insurers have settled COVID-related death claims worth close to Rs 2,060 crore so far.

Neutral HDFC Life Insurance; target of Rs 750: Motilal Oswal Motilal Oswal recommended Neutral rating on HDFC Life Insurance with a target price of Rs 750 in its research report dated September 05, 2021. Motilal Oswal's research report on HDFC Life Insurance HDFC Life has announced the 100% acquisition of Exide Life for consideration of INR66.87b, of which INR7.26b would be paid in cash. Furthermore, the company would issue 87m shares to Exide Industries Limited towards the balance amount at INR685 per share. HDFC Life expects to secure all the approvals and complete the transaction by 30th Jun'22. In FY21, Exide Life earned a total premium of INR33.25b (8.6% that of HDFC Life), and total AUM stood at INR187.8b (10.4% that of HDFC Life). The acquisition would enable HDFC Life to increase its market share by ~140bp to 16.5% (15.1% for FY21) as per the total new business APE. This would make HDFC Life the second largest life insurer, while IPRU remains a close third, with market share of 15.7% for FY21. HDFC Life's market share among private players on an Individual APE basis would improve ~130bp to 16.8%, thus narrowing the gap with private sector leader SBI Life. The acquisition would enable HDFC Life to strengthen its agency channel as Exide Life has a total agent count of ~37k, nearly 34% that of HDFC Life. Exide Life has a strong foothold in southern India, especially in Tier 2 and 3 locations. This complements the overall geographical presence of HDFC Life. The transaction values Exide Life at 2.5x Jun'21 reported EV, which appears expensive in the context of Exide life's three-year premium and EV CAGR of ~10% and 8%, respectively.  Outlook However, given the total size of the transaction, our view on the company does not change. Our EV per share estimates on HDFC Life is likely to increase by 2.5%/~2% over FY22/FY23E as the transaction is completed. Maintain Neutral.

Buy SBI Life Insurance; target of Rs 1645: Emkay Global Financial Emkay Global Financial is bullish on SBI Life Insurance has recommended buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1645 in its research report dated April 29, 2022. Emkay Global Financial's report on SBI Life Insurance SBILIFE reported an impressive set of numbers in FY22, with VNB margin improving 2.6ppts to 25.9% and operating RoEV of 16.4% (19.5% after adjusting for excess Covid-19 mortality). With all its distribution channels firing, expanding product offerings and widening acceptance, we expect robust growth to continue in FY23 and beyond. The formidable combination of brand and distribution reach in terms of geography and demography makes SBILIFE a formidable force in the Indian life insurance sector.

Buy SBI Life Insurance; target of Rs 1580: YES Securities YES Securities is bullish on SBI Life Insurance has recommended buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1580 in its research report date April 28, 2022. YES Securities' research report on SBI Life Insurance VNB margin has inched lower on YoY basis for the quarter on account of SBIL choosing not to remain margin neutral during re-pricing: The calculated VNB margin in 4QFY22 is 26.9%, which is 77 bps lower than the calculated VNB margin in 4QFY21. The VNB margin has been flattish to lower on YoY basis despite an apparent improvement in product mix. This is because when SBI Life re-priced products in August, the re-pricing was not fully margin neutral, especially for the non-par savings product basket. Management averred that VNB margin should expand going forward due to rising share of Non-Par Guaranteed business, Deferred Annuities and Protection. The sequential de-growth in APE was mainly on account of the third wave of Covid19, from which SBIL has already bounced back: Total APE was down 10% QoQ to Rs 41.2bn in 4QFY22. This was primarily due to the third wave of Covid-19 impacting sales in January and February. We think the third wave might have impacted SBIL more than peers since a greater proportion its, generally mass market, customers would be dependent on human mobility. Growth has recovered in March and trends are encouraging. Outlook We maintain &lsquo;BUY&rsquo; rating on SBIL with a revised price target of Rs 1580: We value SBIL at 3.4x FY23 P/EV for an FY23E/24E RoEV profile of 19.8/20.1% For all recommendations report,&nbsp;click here Disclaimer:&nbsp;The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Buy SBI Life Insurance; target of Rs 1450: Motilal Oswal Motilal Oswal is bullish on SBI Life Insurance recommended buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1450 in its research report dated April 28, 2022. Motilal Oswal's research report on SBI Life Insurance SBILIFE reported a soft 4QFY22 with APE growth of 4% YoY and flattish VNB growth (missed our estimate by 2%). VNB margin improved 120bp QoQ to 26.8% while shareholders' PAT grew 26% YoY to INR6.7b. -APE growth was muted in 4QFY22 due to pressure in ULIP and par products. ULIP posted a 6% decline YoY after four quarters of strong double-digit growth. The decline was led by heightened volatility in capital markets due to geopolitical crisis and increase in interest rates. Par products dipped 31% YoY. -Persistency ratio improved across all cohorts with 120bp/110bp QoQ improvement in 13M/61M, respectively. On an ETR basis, EV grew 9% YoY to INR396b in FY22. Operating RoEV was at 20.6% for FY22 with an EVOP of INR69b. This is mainly because it included a positive impact of INR12.2b in operating experience and INR4.1b in VNB due to a change in computation method from ATR to ETR basis.  Outlook We cut our growth projections marginally as we expect SBILIFE to deliver 22% CAGR in APE over FY22-24. VNB margin is estimated to improve 110bp over the same period to 27.0%, thus enabling 24% VNB CAGR, while RoEV sustains at ~20%. SBILIFE remains our preferred pick in the Life Insurance space.

For the full year FY22, GWP grew 16.9% YoY mainly due to 25% growth in First Year Premium (FYP) and 12.4% growth in Renewal Premium (RP). Profit after Tax (PAT) stands at INR 15.06 Bn for FY22. For Q4FY22, PAT stood at INR 6,722 Mn- an increase of 26.3% YoY. AUM grew by 21% YoY to INR 2,674.1 as on 31st March 2022, with debt-equity mix of 71:29.

Buy SBI Life Insurance; target of Rs 1500: Motilal Oswal Motilal Oswal is bullish on SBI Life Insurance recommended buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1500 in its research report dated July 29, 2022. Motilal Oswal's research report on SBI Life Insurance SBILIFE reported a robust 1QFY23 with APE growth of 80% YoY (7% beat) and a sharp jump of 132% YoY in VNB (28% beat). VNB margin spiked 665bp YoY to 30.4% while shareholders&rsquo; PAT grew 18% YoY to INR2.6b. Strong momentum in APE was reflected across all product segments. However, non-par savings stole the limelight in 1QFY23 with a massive growth of 645% YoY. It now forms 28% of business in APE terms. The growth was aided by a strong response to the newly launched product &lsquo;Smart Annuity Plus&rsquo; in Mar&rsquo;22. The notable improvement in VNB margin was primarily driven by a shift in underlying product mix with a larger share of high-margin products such as non-par savings and protection. Together, they constituted 39% of APE in 1QFY23 v/s 20%, a year ago. Retail protection APE growth of 54% YoY to INR2b is commendable, considering the muted performance of private peers. We raise our VNB margin estimates by 340bp and 270bp for FY23 and FY24 to 30.1% and 29.7%, respectively, and raise VNB estimate by 19% each over FY23/24.

Combined value of top 75 Indian brands rebound 35% to $393 billion, TCS leads the pack The total value of top 75 Indian brands had dropped by six percent in 2020 versus 2019 due to slowdown in the brand value of companies in the banking and automotive categories.  The top 75 brands in India have rebounded to a combined worth of $393 billion, averaging a&nbsp;35 percent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) since 2020, when the pandemic struck, driving their value to downhill.  Topping the rankings this year are Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) with brand value of $45,519 million, followed by HDFC Bank and Infosys at $32,747 million and $29,223 million, respectively, according to the Kantar Brandz 2022 report.  The total value of the top 75 Indian brands had dropped 6 percent in 2020 over 2019 due to a drop in the brand value of companies in the banking and automotive sectors.  &ldquo;There is a rebound effect compared to 2020. And then there is growth of tech brands including the B2B (business to business) technology category that includes brands like TCS and Infosys, which is now close to 24 percent of our total valuation, and then there is consumer tech that includes Swiggy, Zomato brands which is 11 percent. Both these categories combined have added to the growth,&rdquo; Soumya Mohanty, managing director, insights division, Kantar, a data analytics and brand consulting firm, told Moneycontrol.  She said that the growth rate of the top 75 most valuable Indian brands outpaced that of other major international markets.  &ldquo;Technology has seen the highest growth as a category and is one-third of our total valuation. Globally, tech is the driver of growth in overall valuation and there are three countries in the world where technology comprises a significant part of the total valuation. One is the US, then China and India. India is now higher than China in percentage contribution of technology to the total valuation,&rdquo; said Mohanty.  She added that TCS is the new number one and has displaced HDFC Bank, which currently ranks second with a brand value of $32.7 billion. HDFC Bank had held the top position since the first ranking was unveiled in 2014.  &ldquo;TCS is also one of the brands that has entered the global top 100 most valuable brands ranking and along with Infosys has seen maximum growth in brand value,&rdquo; Mohanty added.  The top 10 most valuable Indian brands contribute over half of the ranking&rsquo;s total value and there has been significant movement at the top in addition to the two most valuable brands switching positions, the Kantar report said.  There are two new entrants, Infosys which has risen to rank third from 12th, and ICICI Bank with a brand value of $11 billion, which has climbed two places to number nine compared with the 2020 rankings. State Bank of India with a brand value of $13.6 billion has risen four places to rank sixth.  &ldquo;We have 14 new entrants across 11 categories and there are about 11 startups and the number of startups has increased year-on-year. More startups are entering because they are disrupting the market and have headroom to grow. Also, some of the large ad spenders are startups unlike traditional brands which tend to go dark whenever there is an issue. So they (startups) are investing behind brand building. This is what is helping the startups to grow,&rdquo; said Mohanty.  Brand value of the startups category has increased from $23 billion in 2020 to $44 billion in 2022.  &ldquo;Edtech and foodtech are the big segments in the startup space and the pandemic has played a role in increasing their brand value. But that is where we have to see how the change in behaviour is going to impact them. With education, we need to be careful because during the pandemic even younger children were taking online courses, which may change a bit. So education is wait and watch, while food delivery is here to stay,&rdquo; she added.  India&rsquo;s leading brands have grown despite global economic headwinds, and putting the disruption from COVID-19 behind them, said Deepender Rana, executive managing director, South Asia, insights division, Kantar.  &ldquo;The challenge now is to sustain momentum as inflation bites worldwide and consumers and businesses adjust to the new normal. Brand owners will need to work harder to identify and build on what makes them worth paying for and ensure ROI (return on investment) on their marketing expenditure to avoid a margins squeeze,&rdquo; he said.

SBI raises benchmark lending rate by 0.7% The announcement would make loan repayment linked to BPLR costlier. The current BPLR rate is 12.75 per cent. It was revised last in June. The country's largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI), raised the Benchmark Prime Lending Rate (BPLR) by 70 basis points (or 0.7 per cent) to 13.45 per cent.  The announcement would make loan repayment linked to BPLR costlier. The current BPLR rate is 12.75 per cent. It was revised last in June.  &amp;quot;Benchmark Prime Lending Rate (BPLR) revised as 13.45 per cent per annum with effect from September 15, 2022,&amp;quot; the SBI posted on its website. The bank has also raised the base rate by similar basis points to 8.7 per cent, effective Thursday.  The EMI amount for the borrowers who have taken loans at the base rate would go up. These are the old benchmarks on which banks used to disburse loans. Now most of the banks provide loans on the External Benchmark Based Lending Rate (EBLR) or the Repo-Linked Lending Rate (RLLR).  The bank revises both the BPLR and the base rate on a quarterly basis. The lending rate revision by the SBI is likely to be followed by other banks in the days to come. The increase in the benchmark lending rates comes weeks ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy meeting, which is again expected to hike rates to tame inflation.  According to the schedule, the next three-day monetary policy meeting will be held from September 28 to September 30.

SBI Q2 Preview | Strong loan growth, lower NPA to lift profits State Bank of India's net interest income will likely show a modest 6 percent growth but lower provisions can push net profit up 39 percent, analysts say  State Bank of India (SBI), India's biggest lender, is expected to report a robust 39 percent increase in net profit, driven by strong loan growth and improved asset quality,&nbsp;when it announces the numbers for the July-September quarter on November 5.  The quarter-on-quarter growth for most operating metrics is likely to show a big jump, given that State Bank of India reported benign numbers in Q1FY23.  An average of the estimates of eight brokerages polled by Moneycontrol puts SBI&rsquo;s net profit for Q2FY23 at Rs 10,616.2 crore.  That said, analysts expect net interest income to be Rs 33,200 crore, a modest increase of 6 percent year on year. That, along with a likely fall in non-interest income (NII) could keep operating profit growth at 11 percent to Rs 20,085 crore for the reporting quarter.  SBI&rsquo;s core interest income growth has been under pressure for many quarters now owing to legacy bad loans that do not contribute to interest income. The low-interest rate regime following the coronavirus outbreak has also been a drag on income.  Yet another factor for lower NII growth has been faster growth in retail loans than corporate loans. Corporate loan growth has recovered but it still is far from pre-pandemic levels. Loans to companies fetch higher interest rates than retail. As such, loan growth is expected to be robust for the September quarter.    Analysts expect SBI to report a healthy 16-18 percent loan growth for the quarter led by sustained retail loan growth and recovery in corporate loan disbursals.  &ldquo;Healthy growth, margin recovery and lower staff cost in the absence of impact of family pension would drive up profitability,&rdquo; analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd wrote in a note.  The bank&rsquo;s loan book expanded 15 percent in the June quarter, led by an 18 percent jump in retail loans.  Asset quality improvement  Most analysts expect SBI to show steady bad loan ratios. Slippages are expected to be under control for the September quarter. This would mean provision requirements could continue to be low .  Analysts at Elara Capital, however, note that small business loans have been a pain point and could contribute to slippages. For the three months ended June, SBI had reported slippages of Rs 9,740 crore and gross bad loans had formed 3.91 percent of the total loan book.  Analysts expect gross bad loans to remain around these levels for the September quarter as well. Recoveries and upgrades will also be watched and the performance of the restructured portfolio of about Rs 30,000 crore would be keenly monitored.  Margin mantra  SBI&rsquo;s cost of funds is one of the lowest in the industry owing to the bank&rsquo;s unparalleled access to low-cost deposits. Its current and savings account deposits have a large share of 46 percent of total deposits. CASA growth, however, has been benign and the bank has hiked term deposit rates too.  Analysts expect the net interest margin to be stable above 3 percent for the bank given the deposit heft. But the yield on advances may disappoint and put pressure on margins.  Nevertheless, the outlook remains positive for margins and management commentary on the same would be closely watched. Analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services expect the margin to improve to 3.1 percent for the September quarter.  At 2.03 pm, the share was trading ing at Rs 588.10 on the NSE, up 0.55 percent.

State Bank of India records 74% surge in Q2 profit, asset quality improves The largest Indian lender's net interest income rose 12.83 percent and gross bad loan ratio fell to a decade low of 3.52 percent for the September quarter. State Bank of India (SBI) reported a net profit of Rs 13,264 crore for the September quarter, a surge of 74 percent from a year earlier on improved asset quality and healthy loan growth.  The state-run lender&rsquo;s profit beat street estimates by a mile. A Moneycontrol poll of eight brokerages had forecast net profit to be Rs 10,616.2 crore. While the sharp increase in quarterly profit comes from a healthy core interest income growth owing to a smart increase in credit expansion, there is a base effect at play also.  ALSO READ: State Bank of India Q2FY23 earnings: Here are top five takeaways  In the September quarter of FY22, SBI had made exceptional provision of Rs 7,418 crore towards employee pension costs which had dented its profits then. Ergo, the net profit growth for September quarter in the current year shows a larger increase.  Nevertheless, loan growth of 20 percent year-on-year lifted core interest income and also operating profit growth. SBI reported a 16.8 percent increase in its operating profit for the September quarter. Sequentially, the increase in operating profit was a sharp 65.6 percent.  The largest Indian lender's net interest income rose 12.83 percent to Rs 35,183 crore for the reported quarter, keeping with the improving trend of the previous two quarters. The bank&rsquo;s interest earned rose 15 percent to Rs 79,859.59 crore while interest expended was Rs 44,676.15 crore, up from Rs 38,298 crore a year ago.  Asset quality shines  SBI&rsquo;s gross non-performing assets were 3.52 percent of the total loan book, down from 4.90 percent a year ago. This is the lowest NPA ratio reported by the bank since FY12. The total gross bad loan pile reduced by 14 percent year-on-year and now stands at Rs 1.06 lakh crore.  In essence, a reduction in bad loan pile as well as a sharper loan growth has improved asset quality ratios in a big way. On a net basis, bad loans were 0.80 percent of the loan book compared with 1.52 percent a year go. This meant that the bank&rsquo;s loan loss provisioning requirements have come down. For the September quarter, SBI provided Rs 2,011 crore towards bad loans, which was 25 percent less than what it did a year ago. The bank&rsquo;s slippage ratio and credit costs also declined sharply from year-ago levels. The slippage ratio fell to 0.33 percent for the reported quarter while its credit cost fell 15 basis points to 0.28 percent.

SBI targeting loan growth of 14%-16% in FY23, says Chairman Dinesh Khara The country's largest lender is seeing demand from infrastructure, renewable power, oil and marketing companies and services sectors, he added State Bank of India, the country&rsquo;s largest lender, is targeting double-digit loan growth between 14-16 percent in the current financial year, Chairman Dinesh Khara said on November 5.  &ldquo;This quarter was a busy season. That is why we had a strong credit growth. But I still expect, going by the current trend, we should have credit growth of 14-16 percent in the current financial year,&rdquo; Khara said at a press briefing in Mumbai post the announcement of the bank's July-September results.  ALSO READ: State Bank of India Q2FY23 earnings: Here are top five takeaways  He elaborated that within corporate loans, SBI is seeing capex-related demand while capacity utilisation is showing signs of improvement. The country's largest lender is seeing demand from infrastructure, renewable power, oil and marketing companies and services sectors, he added.  SBI&rsquo;s credit growth jumped nearly 20 percent year-on-year in the fiscal second quarter, with domestic advances growing 18.15 percent. The growth in domestic advances was driven by corporate advances followed by retail personal loans.  Indian banks are recovering from the COVID-19 crisis, which rendered many Indians jobless. Now that the economy is recovering, credit offtake has improved significantly. To fund this credit growth, banks are mobilising deposits at a faster pace amid tight banking system liquidity.  When asked about deposit growth for SBI, Khara said that much of it will be depend on how the industry grows.  &ldquo;I can only say that we will not be seen lagging behind industry,&rdquo; said Khara.  In terms of guidance on bad loans, the Chairman said that SBI&rsquo;s endeavour will be to keep bad loan ratios &ldquo;as low as possible&rdquo; with divulging any number. The bank&rsquo;s restructuring book currently stands at Rs 27,336 crore and is behaving &ldquo;very well,&rdquo; he said.  Further, the bank has 14 offers for bad loan accounts transferred to the National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited (NARCL). Progress in loan accounts transferred to NARCL has been happening at a &ldquo;rapid pace,&rdquo; said Khara. He did not elaborate on the recovery expected from these accounts.  Q2 results:  Earlier on November 5, SBI reported a net profit of Rs 13,264 crore for the September quarter, a surge of 74 percent from a year earlier on improved asset quality and healthy loan growth.

Five key trends from Q2 earnings of banks Most banks saw faster loan growth, a reduction in stressed assets and a rise in profits. Though public sector lenders reported the biggest fall in bad loan stock on a YoY basis, most still have bad loans in excess of 5 percent of their loan book The September quarter performance of India&rsquo;s banks has been one of the strongest in recent times. The industry has seen a sharp reduction in bad assets and a smart recovery in loan growth, which have contributed to a jump in the bottom line.  Stress, both legacy and fresh, has reduced for most lenders and loan demand is looking up from corporates and households. Balance-sheet heft has been a deciding factor as big lenders have outshone their smaller peers in performance.  Here is a look at the five key trends from the September quarter results:  1 Big goes better  Size matters when it comes to riding a crisis or even good times that follow. The September quarter performance of India&rsquo;s banking sector shows this amply. The top three lenders&mdash;State Bank of India, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank&mdash;are the stars of the recovery story.  All of them reported faster loan growth than the industry&rsquo;s 16 percent. Together, they accounted for a quarter of the reduction in listed banks&rsquo; bad loan pile (HDFC Bank reported a marginal increase in bad loans, though). On the aggregate level, gross bad loans shrunk by Rs 50,000 crore year on year (YoY) for 30 listed banks that have released quarterly earnings, a Moneycontrol analysis shows.  No wonder then the top three lenders feature as the choice pick for most brokerages.    Public sector wins in asset quality  Public sector lenders reported the biggest fall in bad loan stock on a YoY basis. Gross bad loan stock of the 12 listed public sector lenders fell 15.8 percent for the September quarter, while that of listed private sector lenders fell by a smaller 13.2 percent.  Within public sector banks, lenders which had one of the worst bouts of bad loans showed the sharpest decline. Central Bank of India and Punjab &amp;amp;amp; Sind Bank reported a near 30 percent reduction.  Bank of Baroda and Bank of Maharashtra reported more than a 20 percent fall. The decline in toxic loans was partly due to the upgrades and recoveries but write-offs played a big role as well.  Despite the reduction, most PSBs still have bad loans in excess of 5 percent of their loan book. Private sector banks&rsquo; gross bad loan ratio has ranged 4-5 percent with the exception of Bandhan Bank and South Indian Bank.  Profitability boost limited  While the bottom line of banks saw a 29 percent increase YoY at the aggregate level, not all lenders were fortunate enough to show a net profit boost.  Public sector banks witnessed a 44 percent jump in profits while private sector lenders showed 19 percent. Of the 18 listed private sector banks, four lenders showed a YoY decline in profits owing to either a hit on non-interest income or an increase in provisions.  Among public sector banks, three lenders showed a decline in profits. A handful of lenders increased provisions despite a fall in bad loans in order to shore up their provision coverage ratio. Anticipating stress in restructured loans was also one reason for increasing provisions.  Margins fatten, almost  Another high point of the September quarter earnings was the net interest margin. Margins swelled for most lenders as loan rates were hiked during the quarter.  The commentary from most bank managements on margins is mixed, though. While margins could remain stable or even expand a bit more in the coming quarters, the rate hike cycle will soon catch up with deposits.  Lenders have already begun hiking deposit rates and this will progressively increase the cost of funds for banks. Analysts believe that margins would come under pressure in FY24 and even earlier perhaps.  Watch out for stress  It may be counter-intuitive to worry about stressed assets when all lenders are reporting strong improvement. Granted, bad loan ratios have dropped for lenders but on a sequential basis, some lenders have shown an increase in fresh slippages.  HDFC Bank, IDFC First Bank and South Indian Bank reported a sequential increase in their bad loan pile. Other mid-sized banks have shown stress largely from small business loans and microfinance loans.  For all its stellar improvement in asset quality, SBI saw its recoveries and upgrades reduce sharply on a sequential basis.  Domestic inflation and global economic slowdown are two factors that could upset banks&rsquo; asset quality good luck trail. The jury is still out on stressed assets.

Buy State Bank of India; target of Rs 700: Motilal Oswal Motilal Oswal is bullish on State Bank of India recommended buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 700 in its research report dated November 06, 2022. Motilal Oswal's research report on State Bank of India State Bank of India (SBIN) delivered a robust quarter with PAT up 74% YoY to INR132.6b (MOSLe: INR102.5b) fueled by lower provisions. PPoP growth was healthy at ~17% YoY with margin expanding ~30bp QoQ. The bank reported treasury gains of INR4.6b v/s loss of INR65.5b in 1QFY23.&nbsp; Fresh slippages moderated to INR24b, which coupled with healthy recoveries/upgrades resulted in GNPA/NNPA ratio improving 39bp/20bp QoQ to 3.5%/0.8% in 2QFY23, respectively. Restructured book too declined to 0.9% during the quarter. We raise our FY23E/24E EPS by 14%/6% to factor in higher NII and lower provisions even as we model higher employee expenses due to wage revisions. We thus forecast SBIN to report strong earnings progression at 32% CAGR over FY22-24. We estimate an RoA/RoE of 1.0%/17.3% in FY24. Outlook We revise our TP to INR700 (based on 1.4x FY24E ABV + INR192 from subsidiaries). SBIN remains one of our preferred picks in the sector.

Buy State Bank of India; target of Rs 715: Emkay Global Financial Emkay Global Financial is bullish on State Bank of India has recommended buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 715 in its research report dated November 06, 2022. Emkay Global Financial's research report on State Bank of India Post the treasury hit leading to a profit miss, SBI made a strong come back in 2Q, reporting its highest-ever quarterly PAT at Rs132bn (Emkay est.: Rs95bn) on the back of robust credit growth, sharp margin uptick and lower LLP. Bank guides for sustained healthy growth/margin and reduction in NPAs, which should drive its RoA to ~1% in the mid-term. Bank clocked higher-than-industry credit growth at 20% YoY/5% QoQ, led by strong traction in retail/corporate growth. Bank believes that the impact of rate hikes on credit demand is not prominent enough yet and, thus, expects growth to remain healthy in the near-to-medium term. This, coupled with continued asset re-pricing, should help the bank sustain margins at around current levels, with an upward bias. Bank has seen steady improvement in asset quality, with NNPA now below 1%, given its aggressive provisioning stance; the restructured pool too moderated, to 0.9% of loans. Bank claims that it has not been intimated by the RBI on any standard provision shortfall towards stressed PSU entities, while it remains well covered and hence expects any impact to be manageable. Outlook Factoring-in better growth/margins and lower LLP, partly offset by higher staff cost due to ad hoc provisions towards wage revision, we raise our earnings for FY23-25E by 10-14% and expect the bank to report decadal-high RoE of 15-18% without equity dilution. We retain BUY on the stock, with revised TP of Rs715 (earlier Rs640), based on 1.4x (earlier 1.3x) Sep-24E standalone ABV and subsidiary valuation of Rs206.

Sharekhan's research report on State Bank of India We continue to see outperformance in the stock, given SBI is a sector proxy that benefits from its strong deposit franchise and favorable sector tailwinds. We believe there is an upside risk to margins as transmission of MCLR rates (~100 bps) in corporate loans is yet to happen, which provides sufficient headroom for NIM expansion, offsetting any increase in cost of deposits. Healthy loan growth momentum is expected to sustain, led by robust retail loan growth (homes loans and unsecured loans) and resurgence in corporate credit. Outlook At the CMP, SBI trades at 1.2x/1.0x/0.8x its FY2023E/FY2024E/FY2025 core ABV. We retain our Buy rating on SBI with an unchanged PT of Rs. 710.
