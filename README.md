# LLM_FOR_FINANCIAL_TEXT_UNDERSTANDING
This project focuses on building a financial text understanding system tailored for the Indian stock market. Using a fine-tuned Small Language Model (SLM), the system integrates financial news, corporate statements, and NIFTY 50 stock market data to generate actionable insights such as “Buy,” “Hold,” or “Sell” recommendations.
